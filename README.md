# MSLearn: Creating your first web apps with React

This is my final result of this Learning Path by Microsoft Learn. Since I wanted to use a more modern tool for the project, I ended up building it from scratch using Vite.

Also, since each module just had the same components and files of the previous one, duplicated, I decided to clean up a bit the folder structure and just leave one with the final components and their styles.
